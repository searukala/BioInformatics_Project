# 🤖 AI Use & Reproducibility Log

**Project:** Differential Gene Expression in T2DM
**AI Tool Used:** Google Gemini
**Date:** Fall 2025

## Summary
AI assistance was utilized to generate template scripts for the standard bioinformatics pipeline (STAR, featureCounts, DESeq2) and to debug R/Python syntax errors. All biological interpretation and pipeline logic were verified by the student.

## Usage Log

| Component | Task | Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scripts** | Generating bash script templates for STAR alignment and Trimmomatic to ensure correct flag usage. | Flags verified against tool manuals (e.g., STAR manual v2.7). |
| **R Analysis** | Drafting the DESeq2 design formula and ggplot2 code for the Volcano Plot. | Code tested in local RStudio environment with dummy data. |
| **Documentation** | Structuring the `README.md` and `environment.yml` to meet reproducibility standards. | Verified against course rubric requirements. |
